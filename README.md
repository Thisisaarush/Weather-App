## Local Setup

Don't forgot to add .env at the root of the project with the following api keys -
`PUBLIC_OPEN_WEATHER_KEY=`
`PUBLIC_Q_WEATHER_KEY=`

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command    | Action                                      |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `yarn`     | Installs dependencies                       |
| `yarn dev` | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
